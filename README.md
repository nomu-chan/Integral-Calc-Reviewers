# Integral-Calculus-Reviewers
An intuitive reviewer on Integral Calculus (DLSU-CCS) by Enzo Chan.

NOTE: May contain Taglish (English-Tagalog mix) descriptions in the reviewers. 

## Content
1. Lecture 1 - Integration and Application of Integration in Physics **(will be posted on March 10)**
2. Lecture 2 - Areas and Volumes **(will be posted on March 10)**
3. Lecture 3 - Integration involving Trigonometric, Logarithmic and Exponential Functions

## Lecture 3
Included in Lecture 3 are the following:

1. Class Problem Set
    - Solution Key for integration
    - **[COMING ON MARCH 16]** Solution Key for differentiation
2. Reviewers
    - Derivatives and Antiderivatives of Trigonometric Functions
    - Intuitions on u-subbing on integrals containing Trigonometric functions
    - **[COMPLETE ON FEBRUARY 26 6PM]** Derivatives and Antiderivatives involving Logarithmic and Exponential Functions
    - Another Problem Set (self-made)
        - **Solution Key will be posted on February 26 8PM**

Special thanks to Bon Windel Aquino for being my moral support and helping with the other Probset.
